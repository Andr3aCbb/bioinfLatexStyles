\begin{abstract}
This is a manuscript template for Data Descriptor submissions to \emph{Scientific
Data} (http://www.nature.com/scientificdata). The abstract must be
no longer than 170 words, and should succinctly describe the study,
the assay(s) performed, the resulting data, and the reuse potential,
but should not make any claims regarding new scientific findings.
No references are allowed in this section. 
\end{abstract}

\section*{Background \& Summary}

(700 words maximum) An overview of the study design, the assay(s)
performed, and the created data, including any background information
needed to put this study in the context of previous work and the literature.
The section should also briefly outline the broader goals that motivated
the creation of this dataset and the potential reuse value. We also
encourage authors to include a figure that provides a schematic overview
of the study and assay(s) design. This section and the other main
body sections of the manuscript should include citations to the literature
as needed \cite{cite1, cite2}. References should be included within the manuscript file itself as our
system cannot accept BibTeX bibliography files. Authors who wish to use BibTeX to
prepare their references should therefore copy the reference list from the .bbl
file that BibTeX generates and paste it into the main manuscript .tex file (and
delete the associated \textbackslash{}bibliography and
\textbackslash{}bibliographystyle commands).


\section*{Methods }

This section should include detailed text describing the methods used
in the study and assay(s), and the processing steps leading to the
production of the data files, including any computational analyses
(e.g. normalization, image feature extraction). These methods should
be described in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret
and repeat, if required, the study and assay(s). Authors are encouraged
to cite previous descriptions of the methods under use, but ideally
the methods descriptions should be complete enough for others to understand
and reproduce the methods and processing steps without referring to
associated publications. In principle, fundamentally new methods should
not be presented for the first time in Data Descriptors, and we may
choose to decline publication of a Data Descriptor until any novel
methods or techniques are published in an appropriate research or
methods-focused journal article. 


\section*{Data Records }

Please explain each data record associated with this work, including
the repository where this information is stored, and an overview of
the data files and their formats. Each external data record should
be cited using the data citation format explained at the end of this
template. 


\section*{Technical Validation }

This section presents any experiments or analyses that are needed
to support the technical quality of the dataset. This section may
be supported by up figures and tables, as needed. This is a required
section; authors must present information justifying the reliability
of their data.


\section*{Usage Notes}

Brief instructions that may help other researchers reuse these dataset.
This is an optional section, but strongly encouraged when helpful
to readers. This may include discussion of software packages that
are suitable for analyzing the assay data files, suggested downstream
processing steps (e.g. normalization, etc.), or tips for integrating
or comparing this with other datasets. If needed, authors are encouraged
to upload code, programs, or data processing workflows as Supplementary
Information, when they may help others analyse the data.

For studies involving privacy or safety controls on public access
to the data, this section should describe in detail these controls,
including how authors can apply to access the data, and what criteria
will be used to determine who may access the data, and any limitations
on data use. 


\section*{Acknowledgements }

Text acknowledging non-author contributors. Acknowledgements should
be brief, and should not include thanks to anonymous referees and
editors, or effusive comments. Grant or contribution numbers may be
acknowledged. Author contributions Please describe briefly the contributions
of each author to this work on a separate line. 

AK did this and that. 

BG did this and that and the other. 


\section*{Competing financial interests }

A competing financial interests statement is required for all accepted
papers published in \emph{Scientific Data}. If none exist simply write,
``The author(s) declare no competing financial interests''.


\section*{Figures Legends}

Figure should be referred to using a consistent numbering scheme through
the entire Data Descriptor. For initial submissions, authors may choose
to supply this document as a single PDF with embedded figures, but
separate figure image files must be provided for revisions and accepted
manuscripts. In most cases, a Data Descriptor should not contain more
than three figures, but more may be allowed when needed. We discourage
the inclusion of figures in the Supplementary Information \textendash{}
all key figures should be included here in the main Figure section. 

Figure legends begin with a brief title sentence for the whole figure
and continue with a short description of what is shown in each panel,
as well as explaining any symbols used. Legend must total no more
than 350 words, and may contain literature references. 


\section*{Tables}

Tables supporting the Data Descriptor. These can provide summary information
(sample numbers, demographics, etc.), but they should generally not
be used to present primary data (i.e. measurements). Tables containing
primary data should be submitted to an appropriate data repository. 

Tables may be provided within the \LaTeX{} document or as separate
files (tab-delimited text or Excel files). Legends, where needed,
should be included here. Generally, a Data Descriptor should have
fewer than ten Tables, but more may be allowed when needed. Tables
may be of any size, but only Tables which fit onto a single printed
page will be included in the PDF version of the article (up to a maximum
of three). 


\section*{Supplementary Information}

Names and short legends for each supporting file. Supplementary Information
may include code and workflows, media content (images, videos, etc.),
and any other files required to support the data description or to
help others reuse the data. Primary data files should be stored in
an external data repository, not the Supplementary Information section.
In most cases, the Supplementary Information should not contain text
documents or supplemental figures \textendash{} all textual information
and figures that are central to the Data Descriptor should be included
in the main document. The Methods, Technical Validation, and Usage
Notes sections are all of unrestricted length.
